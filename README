RedLion - A simple testing token

This app's original intention is simply to provide a dummy to pass through a service
that expects Android applications.

It was originally developed using the tutorial:
http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html

As of 8/14/13 it has been run only on MacOS using Eclipse.

To start in Eclipse:
*File->Import->Android->Existing code into Workspace
*Set new project name to 'RedLion'
*You'll probably need to set up a new Android Emulator, which is described in the tutorial.
